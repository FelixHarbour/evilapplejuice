This tape is designed for the ESP32-DEVKIT-V1 board or for other boards with an ESP32 chip.
Spoofing with advertisements about connecting devices is going on, but I haven't thought about how to lock the phone and go into reboot yet, but I saw that this is possible
Its meaning is that it randomly selects a device from the Apple family to connect to the Iphone via a BLE connection. Randomization of MAC addresses also works.
On my clean ESP 32 board without antennas, data transmission works up to 10-15 meters, "punching" two walls
